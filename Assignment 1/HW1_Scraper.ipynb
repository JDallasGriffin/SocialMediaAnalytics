The A4 has a better interior, the top A4 engine (compared to the C240, which is the base C) and it's styling is at least as good as the Benz if not better.   Both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period.    Neither car will be \"low maintanence\" after the warranty runs out, especially the Audi with it's fairly different transmission.   If you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the Audi it's the better value here. <br/><br/>M                        </div>"
